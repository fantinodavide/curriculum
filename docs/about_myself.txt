I am a 20-year-old italian IT student. I studied at Higher Education Institute "G. Vallauri" (Fossano, CN) from 2016 to 2021. I am a self-taught student since a year and now I am looking for a job that could take advantage of all my knowledge and experience.
I know and can code with the most common programming languages, scripting languages and frameworks but since two years I've been deepening Node.js and Vue.js in the last year.

I have experience with enterprise server management and maintenance, I own a HP ProLiant DL380 G7 running Proxmox hypervisor.

Lately, I worked on what I believe could be my "masterpiece", the "Whitelister" project, built  with Node.js and Vue.js to fight the lack of advanced control over players' permissions of three games.
The repository is public and available at: https://github.com/fantinodavide/Squad_Whitelister
With this project I got in touch with people from Australia to Russia and from United States to Great Britain, thanks to that I've been lately working on a collaboration with an hosting provider.
